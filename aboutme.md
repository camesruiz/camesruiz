Camilo Ruiz, Electronics Engineer from the [*Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas*](https://www.udistrital.edu.co) in Bogotá, Colombia. Musician, teacher, traveler, frustrated photographer and a Aspiring Data Scientist.

As a fresh graduated engineer, the need to be always updated on where this always changing world was goint to was key. As curiosity made me explore on how technology is improving every day to make life a bit easier to live, I decided to go deeper in this long but exciting path called Machine Learning and Data Science.

I realised how important it's the fact of not just get information but understand it, translate it and make it useful and in some way contribute to make this world a better place to live.

Welcome to my page! This is my journey.
